## ROG Xbox Ally vs. Steam Deck: Which Handheld Wins?

Curious how the **Xbox handheld** stacks up against Valve’s Steam Deck? Both are portable powerhouses, but they cater to different vibes. Here’s a quick comparison:

| Feature                  | ROG Xbox Ally X ($799)                | Steam Deck OLED ($649)               |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Processor**            | AMD Ryzen Z2 (8-core)                | AMD Zen 2 (4-core)                  |
| **Display**              | 7" 1080p, 120Hz                      | 7.4" 1280x800, 90Hz                 |
| **Battery Life**         | Up to 3 hours (intensive games)      | Up to 4 hours (intensive games)     |
| **Storage**              | 1TB SSD, microSD expandable          | 512GB SSD, microSD expandable       |
| **OS**                   | Windows 11 (Xbox app mode)           | SteamOS (Linux-based)               |
| **Game Library**         | Game Pass Ultimate (1,000+ titles)   | Steam Library + emulation           |
| **Price**                | $799 (pre-order)                    | $649                                |
| **Cloud Gaming**         | Xbox Cloud Streaming included        | Limited (requires workarounds)      |

**Verdict:** The Ally X edges out for Xbox fans with Game Pass and cloud streaming out of the box. Steam Deck is cheaper and better for indie games or emulation, but its OS can feel clunky for non-Steam titles. If you live in the Xbox ecosystem, the Ally’s your pick.
