      <h1>12 Pro Tips to Maximize Your ROG Xbox Ally Battery Life</h1>
      <p className="text-lg">The ROG Xbox Ally is a portable powerhouse, but that performance comes at a cost: battery life. If you find your gaming sessions cut short, don&apos;t worry. We&apos;ve compiled 12 essential tips to help you squeeze every last drop of power out of your device.</p>

      <h2>Software & System Tweaks</h2>
      <ol className="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
        <li><strong>Lower the Operating Mode:</strong> The Ally has three modes: Silent (10W), Performance (15W), and Turbo (25W). For less demanding games, switching to Silent or Performance mode in the Command Center is the single most effective way to save power.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduce Screen Brightness:</strong> That beautiful 120Hz screen is thirsty. Lowering the brightness to 50-75% can significantly extend your playtime without sacrificing much visual quality.</li>
        <li><strong>Set a Lower Refresh Rate:</strong> Not every game needs 120Hz. For slower-paced titles, drop the refresh rate to 60Hz in the Command Center.</li>
        <li><strong>Disable CPU Boost:</strong> This is a more advanced tweak, but disabling the CPU&apos;s aggressive boosting can reduce power consumption and heat with minimal impact on most games. You can do this through a registry edit or community-made tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Turn Off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi:</strong> If you&apos;re playing offline and not using a wireless controller, turn off Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to save a surprising amount of power.</li>
        <li><strong>Close Background Apps:</strong> Windows can have a lot running in the background. Before starting a game, close any unnecessary apps like Discord, Chrome, or launchers.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Hardware & External Solutions</h2>
      <p>While software tweaks help, sometimes you just need more juice. That&apos;s where hardware comes in.</p>
      <h3>The Ultimate Solution: A High-Capacity Power Bank</h3>
      <p>The single best accessory for any Ally owner is a powerful, PD-compatible power bank. It&apos;s the only way to guarantee you can finish a long gaming session on the go.</p>
